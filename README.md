# Applications-of-Graph-Theory-in-Maps-and-Navigation
A detailed project report of Discrete Mathematics CS270 course studied in third semester. It simplifies the practical implementation of Graph Theory, how vertices and edges joined together to make a graph. We have discussed Google Maps for practical visualization like which type of algorithm is used to find the shortest path.
